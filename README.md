## Introduction

This paper presents a novel simulation tool, developed in the 3D training, visualization, and simulation software platform Unreal Engine, able to generate underwater object imagery that is acoustically compliant with that generated by UUV side-scan sonar. \todo{Better to use the third person in tech papers :)} We describe the process to develop, tune, and generate imagery to provide representative images for use in training automated target recognition (ATR) and machine learning algorithms. The methods provide visual approximations for acoustic effects such as back-scatter noise and acoustic shadow, while allowing fast rendering with C++ actor in UE for maximizing the size of potential ATR training datasets. Additionally, we provide analysis of its utility as a replacement for actual sonar imagery or physics-based sonar data.

## Dependencies
* [Unreal Engine 4.21](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/release-notes/unreal-engine-4-21-released)

Other dependencies will be installed while installing Unreal Engine.
